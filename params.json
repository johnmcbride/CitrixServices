{"name":"Citrix Services API","tagline":"A Developer API for Citrix","body":"CitrixServices - A Developer API for Citrix\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA pluggable .NET based services layer for the different Citrix technology SDKs.  This is intended to be a service layer that abstracts the different SDKs and makes it easy to interact with the Citrix infrastructure.\r\n\r\n## What's it about?\r\n\r\nThe CitrixServices project is aimed at being the .NET based, pluggable, RESTful service layer that abstracts the different Citrix product SDKs giving a developer a consistent, easy way to build applications to interact with the Citrix infrastructure.\r\nGiven the pluggablity nature of this project the developer should be able to implement the ICitrixAPI Mobile and ICitrixAPIRoute interfaces, drop the compiled DLL into the plugins directory and implement any SDK to their choosing.\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nCurrently this project is under\r\ndevelopment, its changing as we iteriate through the dev process, and will change as we go. Jump on in and help!\r\n\r\n## What products will be added the library?\r\n\r\nRoughly the first target will be the Citrix XenServer abstraction, with the XenApp powershell and NetScaler abstractions next. That's the initial plan, but as with everything open source, feel free to fork it/branch it and work on the abstraction that interests you!\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nWe are actively looking for anybody to contribute. Everybody is welcome but our only requirement is that you **be nice and helpful**. \r\n\r\nUse this forum both as a learning and teaching platform! :)\r\nWhether you know how to code or not, come join and help build the project.\r\n\r\nWe can use anybody, there needs to be documentation, code, examples, tutorials, etc. Join and help build what you would like to see!\r\n\r\n##Examples\r\nCheck out the CitrixServices.XenServer project in the repo for a quick prototype example (this will be updated as the project goes along)\r\n\r\n##Quick Tutorial\r\n1. Create a new Class library project in Visual Studio \r\n2. Since this project uses the MEF framework you will need to add a reference in your plugin to the System.ComponentModule.Composition\r\n3. You will need to add a reference to the CitrixServices.Plugin assembly. This will give you the interfaces you will need to implement in your plugin.\r\n4. Add a new class to your project called XenServerAPIModule and implement the ICitrixAPIModule interface.\r\n\t1. override the string property Name\r\n\t2. override the string propery Version\r\n\t3. override the method Routes to return a List<ICitrixAPIRoute>. This will be the url routes you want your plugin to listen to and the controller associated to it.\r\n5. Add a new class to your project called XenServerAPIRoute and implement the ICitrixAPIRoute\r\n\t1. override the string property Controller\r\n\t2. override the string property Name\t\r\n\t3. override the string property Route\r\n6. Add a new class to your project called ServersController and implment the ApiController interface.\r\n7. Compile and copy your new dll to the bins/plugins directory of the API site. \r\n\r\n##### API Module Example Implementation\r\n````csharp\r\n [Export(typeof(ICitrixAPIModule))]\r\n    public class XenServerAPIModule : ICitrixAPIModule\r\n    {\r\n        public List<ICitrixAPIRoute> Routes()\r\n        {\r\n            return new List<ICitrixAPIRoute>\r\n            {\r\n                new XenServerAPIRoute{ Controller=\"Servers\", Name=\"XenServers API Route\", Route=\"XenServer/Servers\"}\r\n            };\r\n        }\r\n        public string Name\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                return \"XenServer API Module\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        public string Version \r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                return \"0.0.1\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n##### API Route Example Implementation\r\n````csharp\r\npublic class XenServerAPIRoute : ICitrixAPIRoute\r\n    {\r\n        public string Controller { get; set; }\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n        public string Route { get; set; }\r\n    } \r\n````\r\n\r\n##### API Controller Example Implementation\r\n````csharp\r\n public class ServersController : ApiController\r\n    {\r\n        public string Get()\r\n        {\r\n            return \"A list of configured XenServers\";\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
